Low traffic subs sometimes have interesting posts, but it might be a week or more before there are any comments. This will check the post at intervals of your choice and email you if there is a change.

It's been pointed out to me that the hash of the page was a shortsighted choice on my part, since it will change when the comment changes from "3 days ago" to "4 days ago" etc. I will update this in a future version.
